## Delivery contract
- Follow strict TDD: failing test first, implementation second, green tests last.
- Keep scope limited to the assigned ticket.
- Respect design-system parity rules from `docs/ai/DESIGN_SYSTEM_VAULT0.md`.
- Add explicit `[DEV_DONE]` evidence comment before `in-review`.
- Append one structured memory entry after each ticket.
- Keep one commit per ticket and push when remote is configured.
